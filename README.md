# React Portfolio Example

## Description

[![License: ISC](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-ISC-blue.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/ISC)

This is an example of a portfolio using the latest version of React. This isn't my current portfolio website, since I have not had the chance to test my custom components with the latest version of React.

This website is an example of a single page application which conditionally renders pages when clicked on through the navigation bar at the top. It also contains much of the same information as my website along with a downloadable copy of my resume
