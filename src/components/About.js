				My name is Aaron Key and I'm a full stack developer from South Carolina.
				I started studying HTML in middle school so my friends and I could edit
				our myspace pages.
			</p>
			<p className="about-p">
				I started with some simple static HTML sites, bought several books, and
				eventually started working with React, NodeJS, and RESTful APIs. I made
				some simple but neat projects just for fun, and realized I enjoy making
				things work and look nice and decided to pursue a career in web
				development. I've made some smaller simple websites for local businesses
				and several apps for personal use in things that interest me.
			</p>
			<p className="about-p">
				In my spare time when I'm not fixing bugs or working on a new project, I
				like to play guitar, video games, and go on adventures with my wife and
				our two dogs Goku and Teddy. Goku is a Shiba Inu and Teddy is a
				Goldendoodle.
